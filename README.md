## Creating a BOT and generating BOT TOKEN from Discord Developer Portel

## Step 1: Create a Discord Application
- Visit the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and log in with your Discord account.
- **Create a New Application**:
    - Click the **"New Application"** button.
    - Give your application a name (this will be the bot's name) and click **Create**.

## Step 2: Add a Bot to the Application
- **Navigate to the "Bot" Section**:
    - In your application's settings, on the left sidebar, click on **"Bot"**.
- **Add the Bot**:
    - Click the **"Add Bot"** button and confirm by clicking **"Yes, do it!"** to turn your application into a bot.
- **Customize Your Bot**:
    - You can upload an avatar, give it a description or username.
    - Make sure the **"Public Bot"** option is enabled if you want others to invite your bot to their servers.

## Step 3: Generate the Bot Token
- **Copy Your Token**:
    - Under the **"Bot"** section, find the **"Token"** area and click **"Reset Token"** (or **"Copy"** if one is already generated).
    - Copy the bot token. This is a secret key that allows your bot to connect to Discord’s API.
  
``` ⚠️ Important: Never share your bot token publicly. It grants control over your bot. ```

## Step 4: Set Up OAuth2 for Permissions (Optional but Recommended)
- **Go to the "OAuth2" Section**:
    - In the left sidebar of the application, go to **OAuth2**.
- **Generate an Invite Link**:
    - Scroll down to the **OAuth2 URL Generator**.
    - Under **Scopes**, check **bot**.
    - Under **Bot Permissions**, check the permissions you want your bot to have (e.g., **Manage Channels**, **Send Messages**).
    - Copy the generated URL under **Generated URL**. This link will allow you to invite the bot to your server.

## Step 5: Invite the Bot to Your Server
- **Paste the OAuth2 Invite Link**:
    - Paste the OAuth2 invite link into your browser and select the server where you want to invite the bot.
    - Click **Authorize** to add the bot to the server.
